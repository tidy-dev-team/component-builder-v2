# PropGate Refactoring TODO

## High Priority
- [x] **1. Set up testing framework (Jest/Vitest) with basic configuration** ✅
  - ✅ Installed Vitest with testing library dependencies
  - ✅ Created `vitest.config.ts` with proper configuration
  - ✅ Added test scripts to `package.json`
  - ✅ Set up test directory structure with mocks
  - ✅ Created sample tests for utilities, atoms, and components
  - ✅ All tests passing (10/10)
- [ ] **2. Create proper TypeScript interfaces to replace 'any' types**
- [ ] **3. Implement centralized error handling system**
- [ ] **4. Break down buildUpdatedComponent function into smaller modules**
- [ ] **5. Add input validation and sanitization for user inputs**

## Medium Priority
- [ ] **6. Create missing directories: component_data/ and figma_components/**
- [ ] **7. Standardize file naming conventions (camelCase vs snake_case)**
- [ ] **8. Extract duplicate property parsing logic into utility functions**
- [ ] **9. Implement notification service for consistent messaging**
- [ ] **10. Add performance optimizations with memoization**
- [ ] **11. Create data access layer to separate Figma API calls from UI logic**
- [ ] **15. Add cleanup for cached variables to prevent memory leaks**

## Low Priority
- [ ] **12. Add JSDoc comments to all public functions**
- [ ] **13. Move hardcoded styles to CSS modules or styled components**
- [ ] **14. Create configuration system for component keys**

## Implementation Notes

### Phase 1: Foundation (High Priority)
Focus on stability, type safety, and testability before architectural changes.

### Phase 2: Architecture (Medium Priority)
Improve code organization, performance, and maintainability.

### Phase 3: Polish (Low Priority)
Documentation, styling, and configuration improvements.

### Key Problem Areas
- Type safety issues with `any` types
- Error handling gaps with silent failures
- 148-line `buildUpdatedComponent` function needs decomposition
- Performance bottlenecks with cached variables and expensive operations
- Code duplication in property parsing logic
