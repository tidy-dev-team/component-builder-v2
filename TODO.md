# PropGate Refactoring TODO

## High Priority
- [x] **1. Set up testing framework (Jest/Vitest) with basic configuration** ✅
  - ✅ Installed Vitest with testing library dependencies
  - ✅ Created `vitest.config.ts` with proper configuration
  - ✅ Added test scripts to `package.json`
  - ✅ Set up test directory structure with mocks
  - ✅ Created sample tests for utilities, atoms, and components
  - ✅ All tests passing (10/10)
- [x] **2. Create proper TypeScript interfaces to replace 'any' types** ✅
  - ✅ Created new `src/types/figma.ts` for Figma-specific type definitions
  - ✅ Added comprehensive interface definitions in `src/types.ts`
  - ✅ Replaced all `any` types in main source code with proper interfaces
  - ✅ Updated all component files to use typed interfaces
  - ✅ Enhanced type safety throughout the codebase
  - ✅ All tests passing and build successful
- [x] **3. Implement centralized error handling system** ✅
  - ✅ Created comprehensive error handling system in `src/errors/`
  - ✅ Defined specific error types and codes for different failure scenarios
  - ✅ Implemented `PropGateError` class with rich error context and user-friendly messages
  - ✅ Built `ErrorService` with centralized error handling, logging, and user notifications
  - ✅ Added retry logic with exponential backoff for recoverable errors
  - ✅ Created error recovery strategies for component set refresh and network errors
  - ✅ Integrated error handling throughout the codebase
  - ✅ Added comprehensive test coverage (28 tests passing)
  - ✅ All code compiles and builds successfully
- [x] **4. Break down buildUpdatedComponent function into smaller modules** ✅
  - ✅ Broke down monolithic 148-line function into 6 focused modules
  - ✅ Created `src/buildComponent/` directory with modular architecture
  - ✅ Each module has single, clear responsibility (validation, variants, properties, canvas, orchestration)
  - ✅ Added comprehensive error handling throughout all modules
  - ✅ Created detailed tests for all modules (42 tests passing)
  - ✅ Maintained backward compatibility - existing code continues to work
  - ✅ Added detailed statistics and progress reporting
  - ✅ All code compiles and builds successfully
- [x] **5. Add input validation and sanitization for user inputs** ✅
  - ✅ Created comprehensive validation system in `src/validation/`
  - ✅ Implemented security validation to prevent XSS, SQL injection, and other attacks
  - ✅ Added input sanitization for component names, property names, and user inputs
  - ✅ Integrated validation into main application event handlers
  - ✅ Added validation to UI components (dropdown selection)
  - ✅ Enhanced build orchestrator with data validation and sanitization
  - ✅ Created comprehensive test coverage for validation system
  - ✅ All validation code compiles and integrates successfully

## Medium Priority
- [ ] **6. Create missing directories: component_data/ and figma_components/**
- [ ] **7. Standardize file naming conventions (camelCase vs snake_case)**
- [ ] **8. Extract duplicate property parsing logic into utility functions**
- [ ] **9. Implement notification service for consistent messaging**
- [ ] **10. Add performance optimizations with memoization**
- [ ] **11. Create data access layer to separate Figma API calls from UI logic**
- [ ] **15. Add cleanup for cached variables to prevent memory leaks**

## Low Priority
- [ ] **12. Add JSDoc comments to all public functions**
- [ ] **13. Move hardcoded styles to CSS modules or styled components**
- [ ] **14. Create configuration system for component keys**

## Implementation Notes

### Phase 1: Foundation (High Priority)
Focus on stability, type safety, and testability before architectural changes.

### Phase 2: Architecture (Medium Priority)
Improve code organization, performance, and maintainability.

### Phase 3: Polish (Low Priority)
Documentation, styling, and configuration improvements.

### Key Problem Areas
- Type safety issues with `any` types
- Error handling gaps with silent failures
- 148-line `buildUpdatedComponent` function needs decomposition
- Performance bottlenecks with cached variables and expensive operations
- Code duplication in property parsing logic
